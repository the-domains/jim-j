Everyone has a story to tell. Everyone of us has stories enbedded in the fabric our lives that corrode year after year when they are not shared. These family stories, these tales of the extraordinary and ordinary that friends have lived through and embellished, minimized and hidden, shouted from rooftop and stage and when told the right way, shared with the right people, bring people together, for in every story that is read, each reader is somewhere in that story, reliving their own story.. so to the storytellers, this is for you...
